## Introduction

Explored the process of containerizing frontend, backend and database application. Additionally, it covers examples of the containerization of complete full-stack applications, including MERN setups or the popular Monorepo full-stack applications using Next.js 14+.

This repository contains the corresponding code for all these dockerized applications using the latest Docker features, including docker-compose watch and init.
